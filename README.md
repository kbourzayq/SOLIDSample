[SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) In software development, Object-Oriented Design plays a crucial role when it comes to writing flexible, scalable, maintainable, and reusable code. There are so many benefits of using **OOD** but every developer should also have the knowledge of the **SOLID principles** for good object-oriented design in programming. The **SOLID** principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob and it is a coding standard in programming. These principles are acronym of acronym of the five principles which are given belowâ€¦

- **S**[ingle Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)

- **O**[pen/Closed Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)

- **L**[iskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)

- **I**[nterface Segregation Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)

- **D**[ependency Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)


This project has code snippets which show how applying SOLID principles effects code design.

For each principle, there are two files in Sources folder;

 - **Before.XX** files: A default implementation of sample case

 - **After.XX** files: Related Principle applied version of the case

to show the difference in simple and clear way.
